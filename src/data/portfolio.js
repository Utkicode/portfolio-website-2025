            "I’m Utkarsh Gupta, a Full Stack Java Developer turned Product Support Consultant with 3+ years of total experience, working at the intersection of technology, product, and business outcomes.",
            "My career spans hands-on Java development and consulting, which gives me a strong end-to-end view of how products are built, shipped, and experienced by users. I don’t start with code—I start with the problem, the user, and the business impact, then work backward to the right technical solution.",
            "I follow a product-first mindset: understanding user pain points, identifying root causes, and aligning solutions with measurable business goals. Whether it’s improving system usability, optimizing workflows, or supporting complex products in production, I focus on delivering value—not just functionality.",
            "What sets me apart is my ability to bridge deep technical understanding with clear communication and stakeholder alignment. I translate complexity into clarity and ensure solutions make sense for users, teams, and the business alike."
